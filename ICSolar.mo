                                                                                                                          OK, I see now that my logic is delivering, somehow, an output of 0 if the mod or col is trying to choose the last row or column. 

                                                                                                                          So was it necessary to take the parameter designations off the integer inputs?

                                                                                                                          Evidently yes. still sorting that one out, but let's not get distracted.
